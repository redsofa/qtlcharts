[R/qtlcharts](http://kbroman.org/qtlcharts) is an
[R](http://www.r-project.org) package to create interactive charts for
QTL data, for use with [R/qtl](http://www.rqtl.org).
R/qtlcharts is written in
[R](http://www.r-project.org) and
[CoffeeScript](http://coffeescript.org), making use of the JavaScript
libraries [D3](http://d3js.org),
[d3-tip](https://github.com/caged/d3-tip),
[jQuery](http://jquery.com), and [jQueryUI](http://jqueryui.com),
as well as
[ColorBrewer](http://colorbrewer2.org).

The aim of this guide is to explain the basic strategy of the package
and the organization of the code, in the hope that others may wish to
contribute to its development or to make use of different pieces of
the software.

## Basic layout of source

The source for the package is at
[GitHub](https://github.com/kbroman/qtlcharts).
The [`devel` branch](https://github.com/kbroman/qtlcharts/tree/devel)
contains the current development version, while the
[`master` branch](https://github.com/kbroman/qtlcharts/tree/master)
contains the stable version.

R/qtlcharts uses [htmlwidgets](http://www.htmlwidgets.org) as the
basic driver for the construction of interactive graphs: It creates an
html file with links to the necessary resources and opens it in a
browser.

JavaScript and CoffeeScript code are within the
[`inst/htmlwidgets`](https://github.com/kbroman/qtlcharts/tree/master/inst/htmlwidgets)
subdirectory. (When the package is _installed_, the contents of the
`inst` directory are moved up one level, and there is no `inst`
directory anymore.)

The JavaScript libraries are located in subdirectories of
[`inst/htmlwidgets/lib`](https://github.com/kbroman/qtlcharts/tree/master/inst/htmlwidgets/lib).
This includes [D3](http://d3js.org),
[d3-tip](https://github.com/caged/d3-tip),
[jQuery](http://jquery.com), [jQueryUI](http://jqueryui.com), and
[ColorBrewer](http://colorbrewer2.org), as well as a set of basic
graphic panels, [d3panels](http://kbroman.org/d3panels).

The key functions that form the higher-level QTL visualizations are in
[`inst/htmlwidgets/lib/qtlcharts`](https://github.com/kbroman/qtlcharts/tree/master/inst/htmlwidgets/lib/qtlcharts). Each
has an additional file within the
[`inst/htmlwidgets`](https://github.com/kbroman/qtlcharts/tree/master/inst/htmlwidgets)
directory with the code that [htmlwidgets](http://www.htmlwidgets.org)
needs, as well as a [YAML](http://yaml.org) file that describes the
set of resources needed for that chart.

## CoffeeScript

R/qtlcharts is being developed in
[CoffeeScript](http://coffeescript.org) rather than JavaScript,
though the CoffeeScript code is translated to JavaScript and it is
the JavaScript that is ultimately used.

The CoffeeScript code is not that far from JavaScript: the bulk of the
code is basically not different. So why add this extra layer, with
CoffeeScript? CoffeeScript is a nicer language
and is more fun to code, and a number of things are easier or more
compact than JavaScript.

For example, [D3](http://d3js.org) code generally includes a lot of anonymous
functions, like

    blah.attr("x", function(d) { return xscale(d); });

In CoffeeScript, this becomes

    blah.attr("x", (d) -> xscale(d))

Also, in dealing with missing values, or with default values,
CoffeeScript has some features that make life easier. Here's an
example:

    height = chartOpts?.height ? 450

The JavaScript version of this is cumbersome and ugly.


## Basic strategy

For each chart there is an R function that reorganizes the data and
call the [htmlwidgets](http://www.htmlwidgets.org) function
`createWidget()`. This is connected to the file in
[`inst/htmlwidgets`](https://github.com/kbroman/qtlcharts/tree/master/inst/htmlwidgets)
that includes a call to the JavaScript function
`HTMLWidgets.widget()`, which defines the initialization, rendering,
and resizing of the interactive chart.

The code within `HTMLWidgets.widget()` will be relatively simple: set
up the SVG to contain the plot, handle sizing, and then call the
corresponding function in
[`inst/htmlwidgets/lib/qtlcharts`](https://github.com/kbroman/qtlcharts/tree/master/inst/htmlwidgets/lib/qtlcharts).

Those qtlcharts functions then call various
[d3panels](http://kbroman.org/d3panels) functions (which create the
individual panels) and sets up the interactions among the panels (for
example, that clicking on a point in one panel causes a change to
another panel).


## Customization options

For each chart, there are numerous possible customizations that one
may wish to apply. To simplify the maintenance of these options, the R
function for each chart takes an argument `chartOpts`, that is a named
list (in simple cases, a named vector will do). This is passed to the
corresponding CoffeeScript function for the chart, which looks for
specific named components. If a specific option (e.g., `height` or
`width`) is named, the option is used in place of the default.

The allowable options are maintained in one place: the CoffeeScript
code in which they are used. These need to be listed at the top of the
file in a format like the following (taken from
[`iplotCorr.coffee`](https://github.com/kbroman/qtlcharts/tree/master/inst/htmlwidgets/lib/qtlcharts/iplotCorr.coffee)).

    # chartOpts start
    height = chartOpts?.height ? 450 # height of each panel in pixels
    width = chartOpts?.width ? height # width of each panel in pixels
    margin = chartOpts?.margin ? {left:70, top:40, right:5, bottom: 70, inner:5} # margins in pixels
    corcolors = chartOpts?.corcolors ? ["darkslateblue", "white", "crimson"] # heat map colors (same length as `zlim`)
    zlim = chartOpts?.zlim ? [-1, 0, 1] # z-axis limits
    rectcolor = chartOpts?.rectcolor ? "#E6E6E6" # color of background rectangle
    cortitle = chartOpts?.cortitle ? "" # title for heatmap panel
    scattitle = chartOpts?.scattitle ? "" # title for scatterplot panel
    scatcolors = chartOpts?.scatcolors ? null # vector of point colors for scatterplot
    # chartOpts end

The name of the option used within the file (on the left) should match
that used within the R code (e.g., `height` and `chartOpts.height`),
and each line should end with a comment describing the option.
This is so that a ruby script
([`grab_chartOpts.rb`](https://github.com/kbroman/qtlcharts/blob/master/vignettes/chartOpts/grab_chartOpts.rb))
can parse all of these options and create the
[chartOpts vignette](http://kbroman.org/qtlcharts/assets/vignettes/chartOpts.html),
which provides a list of all possible options.

Some charts have multiple versions (e.g., `iplotScanone` with no
effects, with confidence intervals, or with raw phenotype &times;
genotype).  The file [`multiversions.csv`](https://github.com/kbroman/qtlcharts/blob/master/vignettes/chartOpts/multiversions.csv)
lists the chart name and a bit of Markdown code to describe the
version. Also, the order of the charts in the
[chartOpts vignette](http://kbroman.org/qtlcharts/assets/vignettes/chartOpts.html)
is determined from the order in this file.



## R &rarr; JSON

Data is ultimately pasted into the chart file as
[JSON](http://json.org).  [htmlwidgets](http://www.htmlwidgets.org)
handles the conversion from R objects to JSON, currently using the
[RJSONIO](http://www.omegahat.org/RJSONIO/) package, although it's
expected that they'll eventually switch to the
[jsonlite](https://github.com/jeroenooms/jsonlite) package.

There are some occasional annoyances, particularly in ensuring that
an object becomes a hash (i.e., associative array) or an array (i.e.,
vector or list), or that a single value becomes a scalar or an array
of length 1.

The treatment of these things is rather different between
RJSONIO and jsonlite, and so a switch to jsonlite will require some
cumbersome reconfiguration.

## Roxygen

R help files are created using
[Roxygen2](https://github.com/klutometis/roxygen): structured comments
in the R code are converted to the R manual page format with the
`devtools::document` function (see the
[`Makefile`](https://github.com/kbroman/qtlcharts/tree/master/Makefile)).

For further information on Roxygen2, see
[Documenting Functions](http://adv-r.had.co.nz/Documenting-functions.html)
in [Hadley Wickham](http://had.co.nz/)'s [Advanced R Programming](http://adv-r.had.co.nz/)
or the [Roxygen2 vignettes](http://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/roxygen2/), such as
[Getting started with Roxygen2](http://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/roxygen2/vignettes/roxygen2.html)
and
[Generating Rd files](http://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/roxygen2/vignettes/rd.html).

## Tests

It is tricky to test graphics, and particularly interactive
graphics. The basic panel functions in
[d3panels](http://kbroman.org/d3panels) are tested separately; see
[its GitHub repository](https://github.com/kbroman/d3panels).

Tests of some of the R utility functions are in
[`tests/testthat`](https://github.com/kbroman/qtlcharts/tree/master/tests/testthat). We're
using the R package [testthat](https://github.com/hadley/testthat).

We also generate a couple of tests for each of the higher-level chart
functions: in the usual simple way (see
[`tests/htmltest`](https://github.com/kbroman/qtlcharts/tree/master/tests/htmltest)),
and within the context of an
[R Markdown](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com) document (see
[`tests/Rmdtest`](https://github.com/kbroman/qtlcharts/tree/master/tests/Rmdtest)).
These are executed with `R CMD CHECK`, but the results next to be
inspected individually by eye.
