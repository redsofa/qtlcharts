\title{Interactive plot of recombination fractions}
\usage{
iplotRF(cross, chr, chartOpts = NULL)
}
\arguments{
\item{cross}{Object of class \code{"cross"}, see
\code{\link[qtl]{read.cross}}.}

\item{chr}{Optional vector indicating chromosomes to include. This
should be a vector of character strings referring to chromosomes by
name; numeric values are converted to strings.  Refer to
chromosomes with a preceding \code{-} to have all chromosomes but
those considered.  A logical (TRUE/FALSE) vector may also be used.}

\item{chartOpts}{A list of options for configuring the chart.  Each
    element must be named using the corresponding option.}
}
\value{
An object of class \code{htmlwidget} that will
intelligently print itself into HTML in a variety of contexts
including the R console, within R Markdown documents, and within
Shiny output bindings.
}
\description{
Creates an interactive graph of estimated recombination fractions and LOD scores for all pairs of markers.
}
\details{
The usual \code{height} and \code{width} options in
\code{chartOpts} are ignored in this plot. Instead, you may provide
\code{pixelPerCell} (number of pixels per cell in the heat map),
\code{chrGap} (gap in pixels between chromosomes in the heat map),
\code{cellHeight} (height in pixels of each cell in the
cross-tabulation), \code{cellWidth} (width in pixels of each cell
in the cross-tabulation), and \code{hbot} (height in pixels of the
lower panels showing cross-sections of the heat map)
}
