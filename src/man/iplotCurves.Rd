\title{Plot of a bunch of curves, linked to points in scatterplots}
\usage{
iplotCurves(curveMatrix, times, scatter1 = NULL, scatter2 = NULL,
  group = NULL, chartOpts = NULL)
}
\arguments{
\item{curveMatrix}{Matrix (dim n_ind x n_times) with outcomes}

\item{times}{Vector (length n_times) with time points for the
columns of curveMatrix}

\item{scatter1}{Matrix (dim n_ind x 2) with data for the first
scatterplot}

\item{scatter2}{Matrix (dim n_ind x 2) with data for the second
scatterplot}

\item{group}{Optional vector of groups of individuals (e.g., a genotype)}

\item{chartOpts}{A list of options for configuring the chart (see
  the coffeescript code). Each element must be named using the
  corresponding option.}
}
\value{
An object of class \code{htmlwidget} that will
intelligently print itself into HTML in a variety of contexts
including the R console, within R Markdown documents, and within
Shiny output bindings.
}
\description{
Creates an interactive graph with a panel having a number of curves
(say, a phenotype measured over time) linked to one or two (or no) scatter plots
(say, of the first vs middle and middle vs last times).
}
\examples{
# random growth curves, based on some data
times <- 1:16
n <- 100
start <- rnorm(n, 5.2, 0.8)
slope1to5 <- rnorm(n, 2.6, 0.5)

y <- matrix(ncol=16, nrow=n)
y[,1] <- start
for(j in 2:5)
    y[,j] <- y[,j-1] + slope1to5
for(j in 6:16)
    y[,j] <- y[,j-1] + slope5to16
y <- y + rnorm(prod(dim(y)), 0, 0.35)
